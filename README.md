# BankApi
This is a simple Web API that exposes Bank API end points.

This solution is written in ```.Net 6.0``` and ```C# 10```, and exposes 3 REST controllers for operating on Customer, Account, and Transaction data

While the Web API uses C#, the database is configured in MongoDB, and uses MongoDB.Driver v 2.14.1
